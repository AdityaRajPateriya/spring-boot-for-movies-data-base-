configure mongoDB using .env file and application.properties in resource folder, try running main function,
if everything is right then result Whitelabel Error Page will be displayed on local host

Step 2
we are dealing with two types of data movies and reviews so we will create there own separate classes (models) and define related varibales

Step 3

writing rest api controllers (MovieController class)
pulling data from data base into Movie model for that we will need a service class and repository class(interface)
Service class is used to write database access methods
